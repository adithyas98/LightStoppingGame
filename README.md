# Overview
The goal for this project is to create a simplified version of the light stopping game found in
arcades. I decided to replicate this game because I have always loved playing this game at
the arcade as a kid and being able to physically build the game, however small my version
was, meant a lot to me. The game is meant to allow the user to progress to faster and faster
speeds as he or she keeps getting the light to stop on the correct bulb(the green bulb). The
end to the game is when the player loses, by landing the light on any of the red bulbs. The
game uses two inputs(in the form of two buttons) and six outputs(in the form of bulbs). Of
the two buttons, one is used to reset the game, and the other used to stop the light.The
ATmega micro controller is used as a medium to allow the communication between the
physical pins on the board(hardware) and the internally run code(software).This was done
through the use of the GPIO registries,as they exist in the memory of the ATmega chip.In
the end, this project produced a fully functioning game that is very fun to play.
